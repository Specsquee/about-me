## About me update notes!

### 11/30/22
    So yesterday on the 29th this repository was created and 5 prompt questions were added. Some random general knowledge about me. Along with basic HTML framework, and CSS.

    JavaScript:
    Today though I added on a guessing game that requires you to guess a number, and then once you do it provides you the answer. As well as adding a variable to collect a point everytime you answer any of the questions.

    HTML:
    Took away some text and added three lists. Two unordered and one ordered. The unordered were my education and work history, and the ordered was simply a list of 10 places I want to visit.

    CSS:
    Messed around a little more with margins, width and colors. Not super focused on making this look preaty yet. Just taking some time to mess around and giving it some form of uniformity so I do not want to rip my eyeballs out.

    Forgot to update yesterday for 12/01/22. I took the added functions from a partner and added them to the HTML and tested to make sure it would run.

    Today I am just taking out the comments and double checking for any problems before I throw this up on github for grading.
